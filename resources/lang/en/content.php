    'Zettaa is a multisided platform aiming at gathering people through sport activities, may they be as varied as possible. The three founders came up with the idea on a spring day in 2020, as the pandemic was reaching its peak. Tahar Petrucci, one of the founders and an absolute rollerblade fan wanted to share his passion with others by giving some lessons. Unfortunately, he could not find a platform where he could contact other peers and give lessons to rollerblade enthusiasts. “Why not create a space where people from the same area would communicate in order to practice sports together?” And there it was, the passion that was linking the three friends together and that had been the initiator of their friendship.' => 'Zettaa is a multisided platform aiming at gathering people through sport activities, may they be as varied as possible.
